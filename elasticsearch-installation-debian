# Elasticsearch is not started automatically after installation. 
# How to start and stop Elasticsearch depends on whether your system uses SysV init or systemd (used by newer distributions). 
# You can tell which is being used by running this command:
ps -p 1

# Running Elasticsearch with SysV initedit
sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10

# Elasticsearch can be started and stopped using the service command:
sudo -i service elasticsearch start
sudo -i service elasticsearch stop

# If Elasticsearch fails to start for any reason, it will print the reason for failure to STDOUT. 
# Log files can be found in /var/log/elasticsearch/.

# Running Elasticsearch with systemdedit
sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service

# Elasticsearch can be started and stopped as follows:
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service

# To tail the journal:
sudo journalctl -f

# To list journal entries for the elasticsearch service:
sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch

# To list journal entries for the elasticsearch service starting from a given time:
sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch --since  "2016-10-30 18:17:16"


# test that your Elasticsearch node is running by sending an HTTP request to port 9200 on localhost:
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/?pretty"
curl -XGET "localhost:9200"
